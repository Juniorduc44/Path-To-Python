#DC systems: electricity moves through the wire. River where all water flows.
#AC systems: no positive or negative. No flow. Transmit through vibration. Waves over ocean as the ocean goes nowhere.


   #Garden hose analogy
#Voltage would be pressure of water. The force of the electrical charge. potential is always there when hose is on.
#Amps would be the thickness of the hose. Bigger hose more water. Bigger amount of electricity the larger the amps need to be.
#Voltage x Amps = Watts


#12v means you can only hook up 12v appliance. 110Vac appliance and 110Vac plug...then they are compatible.
